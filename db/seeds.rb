# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# Employee.create(email: "kk@gmail.com", password: "123456",  name: "kk", mobile: "9893454121", address:"rajram", type: "Employee", status: "no") 
# Employee.create(email: "i@gmail.com", password: "123456",  name: "i", mobile: "898948234", address:"sangita", type: "Employee", status: "no") 
# Hr.create(email: "hr@gmail.com", password: "123456",  name: "hruv", mobile: "989546833", address:"mukharji", type: "hr", status: "no")
